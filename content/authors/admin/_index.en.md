Hello, I am Masato Tsutsumi.

I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Mathematical Life Dynamics Project at the Center for Survival Dynamics, University of Tsukuba.

I also hold a concurrent affiliation as a Visiting Researcher at the Data-Driven Biology Laboratory, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University.

My research focuses on **quantification of morphology using deep generative models** and **quantification of social stress using mathematical models**.
