    <h3>Morpho-VAE: Expressing differences in morphology</h3>
  </div>
</div>

**Morphology is a phenotype obtained over a long period of time.** There are as many morphologies as there are creatures in the world, and even the same creature has slightly different forms. What are these differences? The research to find out what the differences are has been going on for a long time. I have developed **Morpho-VAE**, a model that expresses these differences using deep learning. With this model, I have succeeded in extracting features that distinguish species/families.

<div class="features">
<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Landmark-free morphological analysis</li>
<li>Robust to missing data</li>
<li>Application to mandible shape analysis</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Kanade: Batch Correction for Single-Cell Transcriptomics</h3>
  </div>
</div>

Batch effects caused by differences in measurement environments are problematic in omics data. Our group developed Kanade by applying Morpho-VAE to cleverly distinguish biological signals from batch effects.

<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Variational Autoencoder</li>
<li>Batch effect removal</li>
</ul>
