## Key Publications

### Morpho-VAE (2023)
**Variational Autoencoder-based Morphological Feature Extraction: Application to Mandible Shape**

*Masato TSUTSUMI, Nen Saito, Daisuke Koyabu, Chikara Furusawa*

**Journal:** npj Systems Biology and Applications  
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41540-023-00293-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41540-023-00293-6)

**Abstract:** We propose Morpho-VAE, a landmark-free morphological feature extraction method that is robust to missing data. We demonstrate its effectiveness through application to mandible shape analysis.
