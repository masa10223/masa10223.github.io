### Morpho-VAE: Expressing differences in morphology
**Morphology is a phenotype obtained over a long period of time.** There are as many morphologies as there are creatures in the world, and even the same creature has slightly different forms. What are these differences? The research to find out what the differences are has been going on for a long time. I have developed **Morpho-VAE**, a model that expresses these differences using deep learning. With this model, I have succeeded in extracting features that distinguish species/families.

<div class="features">
<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Landmark-free morphological analysis</li>
<li>Robust to missing data</li>
<li>Application to mandible shape analysis</li>
</ul>

### KANADE: Why do human-beings become depressed?
I am interested in **quantifying the psychological strain caused by social stress and other factors using mathematical models**. In particular, by using the free energy principle, I have succeeded in representing both psychological negative spirals and those that are not.

<div class="features">
<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical modeling of social stress</li>
<li>Free energy principle application</li>
<li>Psychological state quantification</li>
</ul>
