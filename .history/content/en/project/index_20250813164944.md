## üß¨ Morpho-VAE: Morphological Difference Representation Learning
<div id="morphovae"></div>

### Overview
Morphology is a phenotype acquired over a long period of time. There are as many morphologies as there are organisms in the world, and even the same organism has slightly different morphologies. **Morpho-VAE** is an innovative model that represents these differences using deep learning.

### Key Features
- **Landmark-free**: Unlike conventional methods, no specific point designation is required
- **Robust to missing data**: Analysis possible even with incomplete data
- **Application to mandible shape**: Effectiveness demonstrated in primate mandible morphology analysis

### Technical Details
Using a deep learning architecture based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE), high-dimensional morphological data is efficiently mapped to low-dimensional latent space. Successfully extracts features that distinguish species/families.

### Applications
Wide-ranging applications expected in evolutionary biology, morphology, medical image analysis, archaeology, and other fields.

## üî¨ KANADE: Batch Effect Removal Technology
<div id="kanade"></div>

![KANADE](/images/projects/kanade.png)

### Background
In single-cell transcriptomics, **batch effects** due to differences in experimental conditions are a major obstacle to analysis. Conventional methods have the problem of simultaneously removing biological signals.

### KANADE's Innovation
**KANADE** is a new method that cleverly distinguishes between biological signals and batch effects by applying Morpho-VAE. Using deep learning, it removes only technical variation while preserving the essential biological patterns in the data.

### Key Features
- **Variational Autoencoder**: Efficient representation learning through deep learning
- **Selective batch effect removal**: Preserves biological signals, removes only technical variation
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale datasets
- **Versatility**: Applicable to various single-cell analyses

### Practicality
Demonstrates power in integrative analysis, meta-analysis, and database construction from multiple experimental batches.

### Research Objective
Aims to quantitatively analyze the effects of social stress on individual behavior and physiology using **mathematical models** and clarify the basic principles of stress response.

### Approach Methods
- **Energy landscape analysis**: Physically represents transitions in psychological states
- **Bayesian inference**: Probabilistic modeling of ruminative thinking in the brain
- **Free energy principle**: Analysis based on unified theory of cognitive processes
- **DOLO (Drosophila tracking with YOLO)**: Automated behavior tracking using deep learning

### Research Achievements
Achieves results through multi-layered approaches including psychological state changes during emergency declarations, mouse behavior under social defeat stress, and Drosophila larva behavior analysis.

### Future Prospects
Aims to contribute to understanding and treatment development of stress-related disorders through applications in psychiatry, behavioral science, and social science.
